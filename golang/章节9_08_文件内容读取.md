### 一、Go语言标准库提供的API

***

* encoding/xml包下提哦那个了对xml序列化和反序列化的API
* 使用unmashal可以直接把xml字节切片数据转换为结构体
* 转换安装特定的转换规则进行转换，且数据类型可以自由转换

```go
func Unmarshal(data []byte, v interface{}) error
```

```shell
* If the struct has a field of type []byte or string with tag
   ",innerxml", Unmarshal accumulates the raw XML nested inside the
   element in that field. The rest of the rules still apply.

* If the struct has a field named XMLName of type Name,
   Unmarshal records the element name in that field.

* If the XMLName field has an associated tag of the form
   "name" or "namespace-URL name", the XML element must have
   the given name (and, optionally, name space) or else Unmarshal
   returns an error.

* If the XML element has an attribute whose name matches a
   struct field name with an associated tag containing ",attr" or
   the explicit name in a struct field tag of the form "name,attr",
   Unmarshal records the attribute value in that field.

* If the XML element has an attribute not handled by the previous
   rule and the struct has a field with an associated tag containing
   ",any,attr", Unmarshal records the attribute value in the first
   such field.

* If the XML element contains character data, that data is
   accumulated in the first struct field that has tag ",chardata".
   The struct field may have type []byte or string.
   If there is no such field, the character data is discarded.

* If the XML element contains comments, they are accumulated in
   the first struct field that has tag ",comment".  The struct
   field may have type []byte or string. If there is no such
   field, the comments are discarded.

* If the XML element contains a sub-element whose name matches
   the prefix of a tag formatted as "a" or "a>b>c", unmarshal
   will descend into the XML structure looking for elements with the
   given names, and will map the innermost elements to that struct
   field. A tag starting with ">" is equivalent to one starting
   with the field name followed by ">".

* If the XML element contains a sub-element whose name matches
   a struct field's XMLName tag and the struct field has no
   explicit name tag as per the previous rule, unmarshal maps
   the sub-element to that struct field.

* If the XML element contains a sub-element whose name matches a
   field without any mode flags (",attr", ",chardata", etc), Unmarshal
   maps the sub-element to that struct field.

* If the XML element contains a sub-element that hasn't matched any
   of the above rules and the struct has a field with tag ",any",
   unmarshal maps the sub-element to that struct field.

* An anonymous struct field is handled as if the fields of its
   value were part of the outer struct.

* A struct field with tag "-" is never unmarshaled into.
```

### 二、XML文件读取

***

* 给定XML文件内容如下

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<people id = "100">
    <name>xhz</name>
    <address>bjxc</address>
</people>
```

* xml读取到结构体中

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/xml"
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
)

//People define
type People struct {
	XMLName xml.Name `xml:"people"`
	ID      int      `xml:"id,attr"`
	Name    string   `xml:"name"`
	Adress  string   `xml:"adress"`
}

func main() {
	peo := new(People)
	b, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("peo.xml")
	xml.Unmarshal(b, peo)
	fmt.Println(peo)
}
```

### 三、多层嵌套xml

***

* 给定xml内容如下：

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<peoples version = "1">
    <people id = "100">
        <name>xhz</name>
        <address>bjxc</address>
    </people>
    <people id = "101">
        <name>bbb</name>
        <address>bjdc</address>
    </people>
</peoples>
```
